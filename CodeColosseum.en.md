# The CodeColosseum project

Consider an arena where bots and humans enter as gladiators to fight a game. The game can be multiplayer, and can fall its own way in the spectrum from competitive to collaborative. Indeed, there might be teams and the information flow intra- and inter-teams is up to you to establish when designing the game or configuring its parameters. A player might have teams of bots he has made and configured. Also the kind of control he has on them might vary.

We now have a first engine to set up a space where all this can take place and are currently working at developing arenas (i.e., designing actual games, both in their front-end and in their back-end).

Go to the [GitHub repo of this open source project](https://github.com/dariost/CodeColosseum) or to [this page with first instructions](https://doc.colosseum.cf/coco.html) to know more.
We hope you might find this project stimulating.

We would also be delighted if you were interested in joining into the project:

in fact, if you are an high-school student (or teacher) we would be eager to propose and/or discuss with you about interesting opportunities for Percorsi di Alternanza Scuola Lavoro on this open source project.
The project offers wide opportunities to:

1. acquire or practice a large spectrum of technologies and competences you might be interested into,

2. put these technologies and your work into creations of immediate use and value.

The CodeColosseum project offers an excellent opportunity to learn by doing while also having fun.
