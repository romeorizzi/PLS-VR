# The TALight project

Are you a teacher/student/researcher/executive passionate about transmitting some problem solving competences, techniques, methods or skills?
Do you want to acquire new competences in a lively, concrete and effective way? Do you want to promote them so that they come to new life in your children/students/employers/clients/customers/citizens?
Would you like to promote your discoveries or products?
Would you like to propose an interesting and instructive challenge, or organize a selection or recruiting campaign reaching to the alive ones?

Then TALight offers the perfect tool and open framework for making up your favorite problem into a fully fledged didactic inclusive Montessori toy, allowing to organize and offer smooth interactive didactic paths around it and automatic feedback services to promote autonomous exploration and learning.
Also the social and collaborative dimension is empowered in our approach and vision that has motivated the development of TALight, an ongoing process that we hope will surprise you (also in the future :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:) and to which everyone is invited to participate.

<summary>Do you want to acquire new competences?</summary>
Then we refer to you as a **problem solver**. If you can find out the content for you under TALight, then both an active in-depth learning experience and pure fun are assured.
If no such content is already available, then think about making it while you progress in the subject. In this way you will be given a fun opportunity to learn by doing.  
</details>

<details>
<summary>Do you want to transmit competences or assess them? Do you want to share or spread active knowledge on a subject or a complex tool or product?</summary>
Then you should consider becoming a **problem maker** and forge your content in the form of compelling problems and services. The teachings you will put in there will be sought for and deeply absorbed, and the materials you prepare will be highly reusable.  
</details>

<details>
<summary>Do you want to become a problem maker but know only one programming language?</summary>
Yes, the knowledge or the willingness to learn even just the basics of one single programming language of your choice, combined with the knowledge of your subject and the willingness to communicate and transmit an alive competence are just enough. If you have them you can already set up to make up an effective interactive problem truly hitting on the key issues that you want to dispel and share.
</details>

In good conclusion TALight is a minimal but powerful and flexible open system for the design, the sharing, the experimentation and the use of interactive didactic problems which offer rich ongoing instant feedback services to the problem solver (the student, or trainee, or employee, or fellow research colleague).

## To know more or take part in it

Go to the [GitHub repo of this open source project to know more](https://github.com/romeorizzi/TALight). Explore the example problems in our tutorial collection and/or try our services.

We hope you might find this project stimulating and useful.

We would also be delighted if you were interested in joining into the project.


## An opportunity for collaborative projects among high-schools and with the University

in fact, if you are an high-school student or teacher we would be eager to propose and/or discuss with you about interesting opportunities for Percorsi di Alternanza Scuola Lavoro on this open source project.
Actually, it could be even better and more stimulating to have teams comprising a teacher (or a teachers'network) proposing a set of competences to cover (competences he wants to transmit and believes could be interesting to decompose and boil down to problems suitable to be posed as challenges) and a group of students in the role of problem-makers and designers.  
The project offers wide opportunities to learn by doing and one from another, and for acquiring the technologies you might be most interested into and put them to immediate value.
The didactic paths developed in the project aim to be of immediate use and experimentation in the classes or on the web. Still the project will offer an excellent opportunity to learn by doing while also having fun. And, if we are lucky in the development of the intrinsic possibility for the collaborative dimension of the didactic paths, we will achieve the highest of our results when pretending to be doing something else.
