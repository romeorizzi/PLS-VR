# The CodeColosseum project

Consider an arena where bots and humans enter as gladiators to fight a game.
The game can be multiplayer, and can fall its own way in the spectrum from competitive to collaborative. Indeed, there might be teams and the information flow intra and inter-teams is up to you to establish when designing or tuning the game. You might have teams made up of bots you have made.

We now have a first engine to set up a space where all this can take place and are currently working at developing arenas (i.e., designing actual games, both frontnd and backend).

Go to the [GitHub repo of this open source project](https://github.com/dariost/CodeColosseum) or to [this page with first instructions](https://doc.colosseum.cf/coco.html) to know more.
We hope you might find this project stimulating.

We would also be delighted if you were interested in joining into the project:

in fact, if you are an high-school student (or teacher) we would be eager to propose and/or discuss with you about interesting opportunities for Percorsi di Alternanza Scuola Lavoro on this open source project.
The project offers wide opportunities for acquiring the technologies you might be most interested into and put them to immediate value.
An excellent opportunity to learn by doing while also having fun.
